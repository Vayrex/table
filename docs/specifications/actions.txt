1. There must be ability to add actions to table.
---------------------------------------------------
2. By default there must be remove/edit.

3. There must be add button.
For now we are thinking to add row under thead with inputs/selects.
But it can be a popup or just link to another page, where user can add new item.
Seems it must be configurable.
